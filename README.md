## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About me
This is me, Brian, I'm a student of computer enginneering and I've always had a knack for computers and huuge love for videogames, so, as a child,
I decided to create my own game. I paused that dream, and now, I might just get to it, so expect at least a little bit from me. I love coding 
and want to learn as much as I can, so I'm delving in github's community to learn from all the geniuses out there, you rock!
